    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of the Bot</h2>
    <p>
      The MLS Community Bot is designed for Discord servers interested in Major League Soccer content, games, and predictions. You may use the bot only for lawful and appropriate purposes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You may not use the bot to spam, harass, or threaten other users.</li>
      <li>Attempting to exploit, reverse-engineer, or abuse the bot or its systems is strictly prohibited.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to blacklist users or servers who violate these terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. User Content</h2>
    <p>
      When you use commands such as `/suggestion` or submit data (predictions, profile info, etc.), you agree that we may store and use that data to operate and improve the bot. You retain ownership of your input, but grant us permission to store and use it within the context of the service.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Modifications and Updates</h2>
    <p>
      We may update, modify, or remove bot features at any time without notice. This includes changing how commands work, adjusting the leaderboard systems, or disabling certain features temporarily or permanently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continued use of the bot after changes to the Terms of Service implies your acceptance of those changes.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Account and Data Management</h2>
    <p>
      We collect only the necessary information to run the botâ€™s features. Refer to our <a href="privacy.html" style="color:#00ffcc;">Privacy Policy</a> for full details. Users can request deletion of their data at any time via the support server.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
    <p>
      The bot and website are provided "as is" and "as available." We make no guarantees about the uptime, performance, or functionality of the bot. While we strive for reliability, we are not liable for data loss, bugs, or downtime.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      MLS Community Bot, its creator, and affiliates are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use (or inability to use) the bot. This includes but is not limited to lost XP, predictions, or stat resets due to bugs or maintenance.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to terminate access to the bot or website for any user or server that violates these terms. This can include temporary bans, blacklisting from leaderboards, or permanent removal.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
